# Insight DevOps Project
This is the repo for my Insight Project for the July 2018 DevOps Engineering session 

## Table of Contents
1. [Puzzle description](README.md#project-idea)

## Project Idea
The idea focuses on three tenants:
1. IaC (Terraform)
2. Container (AWS ECS, Docker)
3. CI/CD (Jenkins (blue - green deployment))

The Use of an IaC orchestration tool such as Terraform in conjuction with Docker is sufficient enough for most conifguration mangagement needs that you do not need a specific configuration management tool<sup>[1]</sup>.
